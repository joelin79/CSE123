Plant, Tree, Flower [Complex Programming Problem]
---
You're taking a stroll through the UW arboretum. Inspired by the beautiful garden, you sit down in the shade to write some Java code, making classes for  Flowers and  Trees. As everyone else enjoys the nature, you find yourself bothered by the redundancies between the two classes you wrote. Your task is to identify the common behavior between the two classes and refactor them by creating an abstract Plant class, which will eliminate redundancy and provide a common interface for both.

PlantMain should work after you've implemented Plant!

Expected output:

```
Tulip is being watered.
Oak is being watered.
Tulip is blooming!
Oak is growing taller!
Flower: Tulip, Color: Red
Tree: Oak, Color: Green, Height: 10 meters
```
