⭐️ Location [Quality Practice]
---
Problem Description
The following problem has been completed, but with some poor decisions in terms of quality and commenting. Walk through the slide and fix areas that could be improved!

Consider a class Location that stores information about places as a pair of latitude-longitude coordinates. Each location keeps track of its name (a string), its latitude (a real number), and its longitude (a real number).
Modify the class to be Comparable by adding an appropriate compareTo method. Locations should be ordered first by latitude with locations closer to the equator (closer to 0) considered less than locations farther from the equator. When the latitudes are equal, you should examine longitudes with locations closer to the prime meridian (closer to 0) considered less than locations farther from the prime meridian.
You may assume that your constructor is passed legal values for latitude and longitude. Use the Math.abs method to find the absolute value of a number.
Note - for everything except the compareTo(), the answers can be derived from split-diff-ing this and the last section's solution to Location. For practice, try to solve this on your own, and think about why something is poor quality!
