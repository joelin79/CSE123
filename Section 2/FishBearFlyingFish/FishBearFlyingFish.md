FishBear & FlyingFish [Complex Programming Problem]
---
Two marine biologists are doing a code review when they realize that two classes they've written are highly similar: FishBear and FlyingFish. As a member of their team, you've been assigned to refactor their code to reduce redundancy and enable their analysis code to be run on either Animal.

Step 1: Design
Decide how you will implement Animal. Will you use an interface, class, or abstract class? What considerations go into this decision?

Step 2: Create Animal
Implement Animal, keeping in mind what behavior and data are shared between FishBear and FlyingFish, and what behavior is different.

Step 3: Refactor FishBear and FlyingFish
Now that these subclasses extend (or implement) Animal, remove any redundant code and fix compilation errors. They should still behave the same!

Testing
Use the main method provided AnimalClient.java to test the behavior of your design.

Step 4 (Optional): Polymorphism Practice!
Now that you've created an inheritance structure, walk through the commented-out code in the main method and think about what the result of each chunk should be (output, compiler/runtime error). Run the code and see what happens!
